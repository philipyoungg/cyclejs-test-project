# Cycle.js test
### An simple project I made for testing cycle.js framework

## Motivation
To understand cycle.js data flow and how it works behind the scene.

## What's inside?
- Simple pagination (without history.pushState / any other routing),
- separate modules to component based,
- using reducer for state management on Model-View-Intent framework,
- initial AJAX call. The pulled data can deleted and restored back.

## How to use
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/philipyoungg/cyclejs-test-project
npm i
npm start
```
